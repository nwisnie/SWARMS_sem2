Repository to share some of my Python scripts written for SWARMS VIP project at Purdue<br/>
<br/>
Use my code in "Final Code" for the easiest experience<br/>
<br/>
view https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim-NeurIPS2019-Drone-Racing for more information on the simulation we are using<br/>
<br/>
These scripts were mostly written in my second semester as a member of the team

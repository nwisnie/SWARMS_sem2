The "get_curve.py" and "get_path_A_star.py" scripts will generate a path for you based on 2 input points and the drone's velocity. "A_start_logic.py" is needed to run "get_path_A_star.py". 
<br><br>I recommend using "get_curve.py" over "get_path_A_star.py" because it is generally faster, smoother, and allows for more control on the generated output
